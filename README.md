TicketFrontier Technical Interview Programs
Created by Ryan Wong.

Toolchain used:
Windows 10 with Java 1.8 on Java Development Kit 8 Update 25

IDE used: 
Netbeans 8.0.2

Third Party Libraries Used:
JSoup 1.10

Compilation Steps:
Note: The following steps will assume that you are using the Netbeans IDE. However, the IDE of your choosing may also follow the same or similar directions.
1. Download the TicketFrontier-Test repository from Github.
2. Extract the TEST2 and TEST3 folders.
3. Import TEST2 and TEST3 into the IDE of your choice as seperate projects.
3.5 For TEST2, be sure to import the included version of JSoup as well. This library can be found in TEST2/lib/jsoup-1.10.3.jar.
4. Compile the programs in your IDE.
5. Run the programs.

If need be, you can also grab the source files individually to compile them yourself in whatever environment you wish to. They can be found in the /src file within each TEST folder. Don't forget that TEST2 requires the JSoup library.

Running the Programs:
Included in both TEST2 and TEST3 folders are pre-built .jar files of the most version of the program. These programs have been built and tested to conform to the instructions provided as part of the technical interview.
These builds of each test can be found in the TicketFrontier-Test/Builds folder. If you have the Java Runtime Environment installed, you can run these programs via command line. 
In Windows, navigate to the appropriate test's Build folder, then run the program using java. For example, from the TEST3 folder, run the TEST3.jar with the following command:
java -jar TEST3.jar
Do note that the programs have been built with the instructions in mind, which include procedures for running the program with or without arguments. Please refer to the instructions for more information on how to run each test program.
